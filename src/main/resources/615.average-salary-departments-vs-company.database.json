So the comparison result is 'higher' since 9000 > 8333.33 obviously.\r\nThe average salary of department '2' is (6000 + 10000)/2 = 8000, which is the average of employee_id '2' and '3'. So the comparison result is 'lower' since 8000 < 8333.33.\r\nWith he same formula for the average salary comparison in February, the result is 'same' since both the department '1' and '2' have the same average salary with the company, which is 7000.","templates":[{"value":"mysql","text":"MySQL","defaultCode":"# Write your MySQL query statement below\r\n"}],"testcase":"{\"headers\":{\"salary\":[\"id\",\"employee_id\",\"amount\",\"pay_date\"],\"employee\":[\"employee_id\",\"department_id\"]},\"rows\":{\"salary\":[[1,1,9000,\"2017/03/31\"],[2,2,6000,\"2017/03/31\"],[3,3,10000,\"2017/03/31\"],[4,1,7000,\"2017/02/28\"],[5,2,6000,\"2017/02/28\"],[6,3,8000,\"2017/02/28\"]],\"employee\":[[1,1],[2,2],[3,2]]}}","testable":true,"templateMeta":{"mysql":["Create table If Not Exists salary (id int, employee_id int, amount int, pay_date date)","Create table If Not Exists employee (employee_id int, department_id int)"],"database":true}}
