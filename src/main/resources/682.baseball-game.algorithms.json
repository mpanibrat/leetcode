The sum is: 5.\r\nRound 2: You could get 2 points. The sum is: 7.\r\nOperation 1: The round 2's data was invalid. The sum is: 5.  \r\nRound 3: You could get 10 points (the round 2's data has been removed). The sum is: 15.\r\nRound 4: You could get 5 + 10 = 15 points. The sum is: 30.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExample 2:\r\n\r\nInput: [\"5\",\"-2\",\"4\",\"C\",\"D\",\"9\",\"+\",\"+\"]\r\nOutput: 27\r\nExplanation: \r\nRound 1: You could get 5 points. The sum is: 5.\r\nRound 2: You could get -2 points. The sum is: 3.\r\nRound 3: You could get 4 points. The sum is: 7.\r\nOperation 1: The round 3's data is invalid. The sum is: 3.  \r\nRound 4: You could get -4 points (the round 3's data has been removed). The sum is: -1.\r\nRound 5: You could get 9 points. The sum is: 8.\r\nRound 6: You could get -4 + 9 = 5 points. The sum is 13.\r\nRound 7: You could get 9 + 5 = 14 points.
