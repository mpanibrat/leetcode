Each item has a price.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHowever, there are some special offers, and a special offer consists of one or more different kinds of items with a sale price.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYou are given the each item's price, a set of special offers, and the number we need to buy for each item.\r\nThe job is to output the lowest price you have to pay for exactly certain items as given, where you could make optimal use of the special offers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEach special offer is represented in the form of an array, the last number represents the price you need to pay for this special offer, other numbers represents how many specific items you could get if you buy this offer.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou could use any of special offers as many times as you want.\r\n\r\nExample 1:\r\n\r\nInput: [2,5], [[3,0,5],[1,2,10]], [3,2]\r\nOutput: 14\r\nExplanation: \r\nThere are two kinds of items, A and B. Their prices are $2 and $5 respectively. \r\nIn special offer 1, you can pay $5 for 3A and 0B\r\nIn special offer 2, you can pay $10 for 1A and 2B. \r\nYou need to buy 3A and 2B, so you may pay $10 for 1A and 2B (special offer #2), and $4 for 2A.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExample 2:\r\n\r\nInput: [2,3,4], [[1,1,0,4],[2,2,1,9]], [1,2,1]\r\nOutput: 11\r\nExplanation: \r\nThe price of A is $2, and $3 for B, $4 for C. \r\nYou may pay $4 for 1A and 1B, and $9 for 2A ,2B and 1C. \r\nYou need to buy 1A ,2B and 1C, so you may pay $4 for 1A and 1B (special offer #1), and $3 for 1B, $4 for 1C. \r\nYou cannot add more items, though only $9 for 2A ,2B and 1C.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNote:\r\n\r\nThere are at most 6 kinds of items, 100 special offers.\r\nFor each item, you need to buy at most 6 of them.\r\nYou are not allowed to buy more items than you want, even if that would lower the overall price.\r\n\r\n","templates":[{"value":"cpp","text":"C++","defaultCode":"class Solution {\r\npublic:\r\n    int shoppingOffers(vector<int>& price, vector<vector<int>>& special, vector<int>& needs) {\r\n        \r\n    }\r\n};"},{"value":"java","text":"Java","defaultCode":"class Solution {\n    public int shoppingOffers(List<Integer> price, List<List<Integer>> special, List<Integer> needs) {\n        \n    }\n}"},{"value":"python","text":"Python","defaultCode":"class Solution(object):\r\n    def shoppingOffers(self, price, special, needs):\r\n        \"\"\"\r\n        :type price: List[int]\r\n        :type special: List[List[int]]\r\n        :type needs: List[int]\r\n        :rtype: int\r\n        \"\"\"\r\n        "},{"value":"python3","text":"Python3","defaultCode":"class Solution:\r\n    def shoppingOffers(self, price, special, needs):\r\n        \"\"\"\r\n        :type price: List[int]\r\n        :type special: List[List[int]]\r\n        :type needs: List[int]\r\n        :rtype: int\r\n        \"\"\"\r\n        "},{"value":"c","text":"C","defaultCode":"int shoppingOffers(int* price, int priceSize, int** special, int specialRowSize, int *specialColSizes, int* needs, int needsSize) {\r\n    \r\n}"},{"value":"csharp","text":"C#","defaultCode":"public class Solution {\r\n    public int ShoppingOffers(IList<int> price, IList<IList<int>> special, IList<int> needs) {\r\n        \r\n    }\r\n}"},{"value":"javascript","text":"JavaScript","defaultCode":"/**\r\n * @param {number[]} price\r\n * @param {number[][]} special\r\n * @param {number[]} needs\r\n * @return {number}\r\n */\r\nvar shoppingOffers = function(price, special, needs) {\r\n    \r\n};"},{"value":"ruby","text":"Ruby","defaultCode":"# @param {Integer[]} price\r\n# @param {Integer[][]} special\r\n# @param {Integer[]} needs\r\n# @return {Integer}\r\ndef shopping_offers(price, special, needs)\r\n    \r\nend"},{"value":"swift","text":"Swift","defaultCode":"class Solution {\n    func shoppingOffers(_ price: [Int], _ special: [[Int]], _ needs: [Int]) -> Int {\n\n    }\n}"},{"value":"golang","text":"Go","defaultCode":"func shoppingOffers(price []int, special [][]int, needs []int) int {\r\n    \r\n}"},{"value":"scala","text":"Scala","defaultCode":"object Solution {\n    def shoppingOffers(price: List[Int], special: List[List[Int]], needs: List[Int]): Int = {\n        \n    }\n}"},{"value":"kotlin","text":"Kotlin","defaultCode":"class Solution {\n    fun shoppingOffers(price: List<Int>, special: List<List<Int>>, needs: List<Int>): Int {\n        \n    }\n}"}],"testcase":"[2,5]\n[[3,0,5],[1,2,10]]\n[3,2]","testable":true,"templateMeta":{"name":"shoppingOffers","params":[{"name":"price","type":"list<integer>"},{"name":"special","type":"list<list<integer>>"},{"name":"needs","type":"list<integer>"}],"return":{"type":"integer"}}}
