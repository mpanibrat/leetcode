Each cell interacts with its eight neighbors (horizontal, vertical, diagonal) using the following four rules (taken from the above Wikipedia article):\r\n\r\n\r\n\tAny live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies, as if caused by under-population.\r\n\tAny live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation.\r\n\tAny live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by over-population..\r\n\tAny dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.\r\n\r\n\r\nWrite a function to compute the next state (after one update) of the board given its current state. The next state is created by applying the above rules simultaneously to every cell in the current state, where births and deaths occur simultaneously.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n\r\n\r\nInput: \r\n[\r\n  [0,1,0],\r\n  [0,0,1],\r\n  [1,1,1],\r\n  [0,0,0]\r\n]\r\nOutput: \r\n[\r\n  [0,0,0],\r\n  [1,0,1],\r\n  [0,1,1],\r\n  [0,1,0]\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\nFollow up:\r\n\r\n\r\n\tCould you solve it in-place? Remember that the board needs to be updated at the same time: You cannot update some cells first and then use their updated values to update other cells.\r\n\tIn this question, we represent the board using a 2D array. In principle, the board is infinite, which would cause problems when the active area encroaches the border of the array. How would you address these problems?\r\n\r\n","templates":[{"value":"cpp","text":"C++","defaultCode":"class Solution {\r\npublic:\r\n    void gameOfLife(vector<vector<int>>& board) {\r\n        \r\n    }\r\n};"},{"value":"java","text":"Java","defaultCode":"class Solution {\r\n    public void gameOfLife(int[][] board) {\r\n        \r\n    }\r\n}"},{"value":"python","text":"Python","defaultCode":"class Solution(object):\r\n    def gameOfLife(self, board):\r\n        \"\"\"\r\n        :type board: List[List[int]]\r\n        :rtype: void Do not return anything, modify board in-place instead.\r\n        \"\"\"\r\n        "},{"value":"python3","text":"Python3","defaultCode":"class Solution:\r\n    def gameOfLife(self, board):\r\n        \"\"\"\r\n        :type board: List[List[int]]\r\n        :rtype: void Do not return anything, modify board in-place instead.\r\n        \"\"\"\r\n        "},{"value":"c","text":"C","defaultCode":"void gameOfLife(int** board, int boardRowSize, int *boardColSizes) {\r\n    \r\n}"},{"value":"csharp","text":"C#","defaultCode":"public class Solution {\r\n    public void GameOfLife(int[][] board) {\r\n        \r\n    }\r\n}"},{"value":"javascript","text":"JavaScript","defaultCode":"/**\r\n * @param {number[][]} board\r\n * @return {void} Do not return anything, modify board in-place instead.\r\n */\r\nvar gameOfLife = function(board) {\r\n    \r\n};"},{"value":"ruby","text":"Ruby","defaultCode":"# @param {Integer[][]} board\r\n# @return {Void} Do not return anything, modify board in-place instead.\r\ndef game_of_life(board)\r\n    \r\nend"},{"value":"swift","text":"Swift","defaultCode":"class Solution {\n    func gameOfLife(_ board: inout [[Int]]) {\n\n    }\n}"},{"value":"golang","text":"Go","defaultCode":"func gameOfLife(board [][]int)  {\r\n    \r\n}"},{"value":"scala","text":"Scala","defaultCode":"object Solution {\r\n    def gameOfLife(board: Array[Array[Int]]): Unit = {\r\n        \r\n    }\r\n}"},{"value":"kotlin","text":"Kotlin","defaultCode":"class Solution {\r\n    fun gameOfLife(board: Array<IntArray>): Unit {\r\n        \r\n    }\r\n}"}],"testcase":"[[0,1,0],[0,0,1],[1,1,1],[0,0,0]]","testable":true,"templateMeta":{"name":"gameOfLife","params":[{"name":"board","type":"integer[][]"}],"return":{"type":"void"},"output":{"paramindex":0}}}
