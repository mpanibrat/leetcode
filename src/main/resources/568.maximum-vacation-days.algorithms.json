But all work and no play makes Jack a dull boy, you could take vacations in some particular cities and weeks. Your job is to schedule the traveling to maximize the number of vacation days you could take, but there are certain rules and restrictions you need to follow.\r\n\r\n\r\nRules and restrictions:\r\n\r\nYou can only travel among N cities, represented by indexes from 0 to N-1. Initially, you are in the city indexed 0 on Monday.\r\nThe cities are connected by flights. The flights are represented as a N*N matrix (not necessary symmetrical), called flights representing the airline status from the city i to the city j. If there is no flight from the city i to the city j, flights[i][j] = 0; Otherwise, flights[i][j] = 1. Also, flights[i][i] = 0 for all i.\r\nYou totally have K weeks (each week has 7 days) to travel. You can only take flights at most once per day and can only take flights on each week's Monday morning. Since flight time is so short, we don't consider the impact of flight time.\r\nFor each city, you can only have restricted vacation days in different weeks, given an N*K matrix called days representing this relationship. For the value of days[i][j], it represents the maximum days you could take vacation in the city i in the week j.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYou're given the flights matrix and days matrix, and you need to output the maximum vacation days you could take during K weeks.\r\n\r\nExample 1:\r\n\r\nInput:flights = [[0,1,1],[1,0,1],[1,1,0]], days = [[1,3,1],[6,0,3],[3,3,3]]\r\nOutput: 12\r\nExplanation: Ans = 6 + 3 + 3 = 12. \r\nOne of the best strategies is:\r\n1st week : fly from city 0 to city 1 on Monday, and play 6 days and work 1 day. (Although you start at city 0, we could also fly to and start at other cities since it is Monday.) \r\n2nd week : fly from city 1 to city 2 on Monday, and play 3 days and work 4 days.\r\n3rd week : stay at city 2, and play 3 days and work 4 days.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExample 2:\r\n\r\nInput:flights = [[0,0,0],[0,0,0],[0,0,0]], days = [[1,1,1],[7,7,7],[7,7,7]]\r\nOutput: 3\r\nExplanation: Ans = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3. \r\nSince there is no flights enable you to move to another city, you have to stay at city 0 for the whole 3 weeks. For each week, you only have one day to play and six days to work. So the maximum number of vacation days is 3.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExample 3:\r\n\r\nInput:flights = [[0,1,1],[1,0,1],[1,1,0]], days = [[7,0,0],[0,7,0],[0,0,7]]\r\nOutput: 21\r\nExplanation:Ans = 7 + 7 + 7 = 21\r\nOne of the best strategies is:\r\n1st week : stay at city 0, and play 7 days. \r\n2nd week : fly from city 0 to city 1 on Monday, and play 7 days.\r\n3rd week : fly from city 1 to city 2 on Monday, and play 7 days.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNote:\r\n\r\nN and K are positive integers, which are in the range of [1, 100].\r\nIn the matrix flights, all the values are integers in the range of [0, 1].\r\nIn the matrix days, all the values are integers in the range [0, 7].\r\nYou could stay at a city beyond the number of vacation days, but you should work on the extra days, which won't be counted as vacation days.\r\nIf you fly from the city A to the city B and take the vacation on that day, the deduction towards vacation days will count towards the vacation days of city B in that week.\r\nWe don't consider the impact of flight hours towards the calculation of vacation days.\r\n\r\n","templates":[{"value":"cpp","text":"C++","defaultCode":"class Solution {\r\npublic:\r\n    int maxVacationDays(vector<vector<int>>& flights, vector<vector<int>>& days) {\r\n        \r\n    }\r\n};"},{"value":"java","text":"Java","defaultCode":"class Solution {\r\n    public int maxVacationDays(int[][] flights, int[][] days) {\r\n        \r\n    }\r\n}"},{"value":"python","text":"Python","defaultCode":"class Solution(object):\r\n    def maxVacationDays(self, flights, days):\r\n        \"\"\"\r\n        :type flights: List[List[int]]\r\n        :type days: List[List[int]]\r\n        :rtype: int\r\n        \"\"\"\r\n        "},{"value":"python3","text":"Python3","defaultCode":"class Solution:\r\n    def maxVacationDays(self, flights, days):\r\n        \"\"\"\r\n        :type flights: List[List[int]]\r\n        :type days: List[List[int]]\r\n        :rtype: int\r\n        \"\"\"\r\n        "},{"value":"c","text":"C","defaultCode":"int maxVacationDays(int** flights, int flightsRowSize, int *flightsColSizes, int** days, int daysRowSize, int *daysColSizes) {\n    \n}"},{"value":"csharp","text":"C#","defaultCode":"public class Solution {\r\n    public int MaxVacationDays(int[,] flights, int[,] days) {\r\n        \r\n    }\r\n}"},{"value":"javascript","text":"JavaScript","defaultCode":"/**\r\n * @param {number[][]} flights\r\n * @param {number[][]} days\r\n * @return {number}\r\n */\r\nvar maxVacationDays = function(flights, days) {\r\n    \r\n};"},{"value":"ruby","text":"Ruby","defaultCode":"# @param {Integer[][]} flights\r\n# @param {Integer[][]} days\r\n# @return {Integer}\r\ndef max_vacation_days(flights, days)\r\n    \r\nend"},{"value":"swift","text":"Swift","defaultCode":"class Solution {\n    func maxVacationDays(_ flights: [[Int]], _ days: [[Int]]) -> Int {\n\n    }\n}"},{"value":"golang","text":"Go","defaultCode":"func maxVacationDays(flights [][]int, days [][]int) int {\r\n    \r\n}"},{"value":"scala","text":"Scala","defaultCode":"object Solution {\r\n    def maxVacationDays(flights: Array[Array[Int]], days: Array[Array[Int]]): Int = {\r\n        \r\n    }\r\n}"},{"value":"kotlin","text":"Kotlin","defaultCode":"class Solution {\r\n    fun maxVacationDays(flights: Array<IntArray>, days: Array<IntArray>): Int {\r\n        \r\n    }\r\n}"}],"testcase":"[[0,1,1],[1,0,1],[1,1,0]]\n[[1,3,1],[6,0,3],[3,3,3]]","testable":true,"templateMeta":{"name":"maxVacationDays","params":[{"name":"flights","type":"integer[][]"},{"name":"days","type":"integer[][]"}],"return":{"type":"integer"}}}
