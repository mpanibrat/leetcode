Now, you're given n teams, you need to output their final contest matches in the form of a string.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe n teams are given in the form of positive integers from 1 to n, which represents their initial rank. (Rank 1 is the strongest team and Rank n is the weakest team.) We'll use parentheses('(', ')') and commas(',') to represent the contest team pairing - parentheses('(' , ')') for pairing and commas(',') for partition. During the pairing process in each round, you always need to follow the strategy of making the rather strong one pair with the rather weak one. \r\n\r\nExample 1:\r\n\r\nInput: 2\r\nOutput: (1,2)\r\nExplanation: \r\nInitially, we have the team 1 and the team 2, placed like: 1,2.\r\nThen we pair the team (1,2) together with '(', ')' and ',', which is the final answer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExample 2:\r\n\r\nInput: 4\r\nOutput: ((1,4),(2,3))\r\nExplanation: \r\nIn the first round, we pair the team 1 and 4, the team 2 and 3 together, as we need to make the strong team and weak team together.\r\nAnd we got (1,4),(2,3).\r\nIn the second round, the winners of (1,4) and (2,3) need to play again to generate the final winner, so you need to add the paratheses outside them.\r\nAnd we got the final answer ((1,4),(2,3)).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExample 3:\r\n\r\nInput: 8\r\nOutput: (((1,8),(4,5)),((2,7),(3,6)))\r\nExplanation: \r\nFirst round: (1,8),(2,7),(3,6),(4,5)\r\nSecond round: ((1,8),(4,5)),((2,7),(3,6))\r\nThird round: (((1,8),(4,5)),((2,7),(3,6)))\r\nSince the third round will generate the final winner, you need to output the answer (((1,8),(4,5)),((2,7),(3,6))).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNote:\r\n\r\nThe n is in range [2, 212].\r\nWe ensure that the input n can be converted into the form 2k, where k is a positive integer.\r\n\r\n","templates":[{"value":"cpp","text":"C++","defaultCode":"class Solution {\npublic:\n    string findContestMatch(int n) {\n        \n    }\n};"},{"value":"java","text":"Java","defaultCode":"class Solution {\n    public String findContestMatch(int n) {\n        \n    }\n}"},{"value":"python","text":"Python","defaultCode":"class Solution(object):\n    def findContestMatch(self, n):\n        \"\"\"\n        :type n: int\n        :rtype: str\n        \"\"\"\n        "},{"value":"python3","text":"Python3","defaultCode":"class Solution:\n    def findContestMatch(self, n):\n        \"\"\"\n        :type n: int\n        :rtype: str\n        \"\"\"\n        "},{"value":"c","text":"C","defaultCode":"char* findContestMatch(int n) {\n    \n}"},{"value":"csharp","text":"C#","defaultCode":"public class Solution {\n    public string FindContestMatch(int n) {\n        \n    }\n}"},{"value":"javascript","text":"JavaScript","defaultCode":"/**\n * @param {number} n\n * @return {string}\n */\nvar findContestMatch = function(n) {\n    \n};"},{"value":"ruby","text":"Ruby","defaultCode":"# @param {Integer} n\n# @return {String}\ndef find_contest_match(n)\n    \nend"},{"value":"swift","text":"Swift","defaultCode":"class Solution {\n    func findContestMatch(_ n: Int) -> String {\n\n    }\n}"},{"value":"golang","text":"Go","defaultCode":"func findContestMatch(n int) string {\n    \n}"},{"value":"scala","text":"Scala","defaultCode":"object Solution {\n    def findContestMatch(n: Int): String = {\n        \n    }\n}"},{"value":"kotlin","text":"Kotlin","defaultCode":"class Solution {\n    fun findContestMatch(n: Int): String {\n        \n    }\n}"}],"testcase":"4","testable":true,"templateMeta":{"name":"findContestMatch","params":[{"name":"n","type":"integer"}],"return":{"type":"string"}}}
