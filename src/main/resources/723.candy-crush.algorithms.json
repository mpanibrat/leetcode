A value of board[i][j] = 0 represents that the cell at position (i, j) is empty. The given board represents the state of the game following the player's move. Now, you need to restore the board to a stable state by crushing candies according to the following rules:\r\n\r\n\r\n\tIf three or more candies of the same type are adjacent vertically or horizontally, \"crush\" them all at the same time - these positions become empty.\r\n\tAfter crushing all candies simultaneously, if an empty space on the board has candies on top of itself, then these candies will drop until they hit a candy or bottom at the same time. (No new candies will drop outside the top boundary.)\r\n\tAfter the above steps, there may exist more candies that can be crushed. If so, you need to repeat the above steps.\r\n\tIf there does not exist more candies that can be crushed (ie. the board is stable), then return the current board.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou need to perform the above rules until the board becomes stable, then return the current board.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nExample:\r\n\r\n\r\nInput:\r\nboard = \r\n[[110,5,112,113,114],[210,211,5,213,214],[310,311,3,313,314],[410,411,412,5,414],[5,1,512,3,3],[610,4,1,613,614],[710,1,2,713,714],[810,1,2,1,1],[1,1,2,2,2],[4,1,4,4,1014]]\r\n\r\nOutput:\r\n[[0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0],[110,0,0,0,114],[210,0,0,0,214],[310,0,0,113,314],[410,0,0,213,414],[610,211,112,313,614],[710,311,412,613,714],[810,411,512,713,1014]]\r\n\r\nExplanation: \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nNote:\r\n\r\n\r\n\tThe length of board will be in the range [3, 50].\r\n\tThe length of board[i] will be in the range [3, 50].\r\n\tEach board[i][j] will initially start as an integer in the range [1, 2000].\r\n\r\n","templates":[{"value":"cpp","text":"C++","defaultCode":"class Solution {\r\npublic:\r\n    vector<vector<int>> candyCrush(vector<vector<int>>& board) {\r\n        \r\n    }\r\n};"},{"value":"java","text":"Java","defaultCode":"class Solution {\r\n    public int[][] candyCrush(int[][] board) {\r\n        \r\n    }\r\n}"},{"value":"python","text":"Python","defaultCode":"class Solution(object):\r\n    def candyCrush(self, board):\r\n        \"\"\"\r\n        :type board: List[List[int]]\r\n        :rtype: List[List[int]]\r\n        \"\"\"\r\n        "},{"value":"python3","text":"Python3","defaultCode":"class Solution:\r\n    def candyCrush(self, board):\r\n        \"\"\"\r\n        :type board: List[List[int]]\r\n        :rtype: List[List[int]]\r\n        \"\"\"\r\n        "},{"value":"c","text":"C","defaultCode":"/**\r\n * Return an array of arrays of size *returnSize.\r\n * The sizes of the arrays are returned as *columnSizes array.\r\n * Note: Both returned array and *columnSizes array must be malloced, assume caller calls free().\r\n */\r\nint** candyCrush(int** board, int boardRowSize, int boardColSize, int** columnSizes, int* returnSize) {\r\n    \r\n}"},{"value":"csharp","text":"C#","defaultCode":"public class Solution {\r\n    public int[,] CandyCrush(int[,] board) {\r\n        \r\n    }\r\n}"},{"value":"javascript","text":"JavaScript","defaultCode":"/**\r\n * @param {number[][]} board\r\n * @return {number[][]}\r\n */\r\nvar candyCrush = function(board) {\r\n    \r\n};"},{"value":"ruby","text":"Ruby","defaultCode":"# @param {Integer[][]} board\r\n# @return {Integer[][]}\r\ndef candy_crush(board)\r\n    \r\nend"},{"value":"swift","text":"Swift","defaultCode":"class Solution {\r\n    func candyCrush(_ board: [[Int]]) -> [[Int]] {\r\n\r\n    }\r\n}"},{"value":"golang","text":"Go","defaultCode":"func candyCrush(board [][]int) [][]int {\r\n    \r\n}"},{"value":"scala","text":"Scala","defaultCode":"object Solution {\r\n    def candyCrush(board: Array[Array[Int]]): Array[Array[Int]] = {\r\n        \r\n    }\r\n}"},{"value":"kotlin","text":"Kotlin","defaultCode":"class Solution {\r\n    fun candyCrush(board: Array<IntArray>): Array<IntArray> {\r\n        \r\n    }\r\n}"}],"testcase":"[[110,5,112,113,114],[210,211,5,213,214],[310,311,3,313,314],[410,411,412,5,414],[5,1,512,3,3],[610,4,1,613,614],[710,1,2,713,714],[810,1,2,1,1],[1,1,2,2,2],[4,1,4,4,1014]]","testable":true,"templateMeta":{"name":"candyCrush","params":[{"name":"board","type":"integer[][]"}],"return":{"type":"integer[][]"}}}
