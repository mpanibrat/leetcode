Now given two tables as below:\r\n\r\nTable: friend_request\r\n\r\n| sender_id | send_to_id |request_date|\r\n|-----------|------------|------------|\r\n| 1         | 2          | 2016_06-01 |\r\n| 1         | 3          | 2016_06-01 |\r\n| 1         | 4          | 2016_06-01 |\r\n| 2         | 3          | 2016_06-02 |\r\n| 3         | 4          | 2016-06-09 |\r\n\r\n\r\nTable: request_accepted\r\n\r\n| requester_id | accepter_id |accept_date |\r\n|--------------|-------------|------------|\r\n| 1            | 2           | 2016_06-03 |\r\n| 1            | 3           | 2016-06-08 |\r\n| 2            | 3           | 2016-06-08 |\r\n| 3            | 4           | 2016-06-09 |\r\n| 3            | 4           | 2016-06-10 |\r\n\r\n\r\nWrite a query to find the overall acceptance rate of requests rounded to 2 decimals, which is the number of acceptance divide the number of requests.\r\n\r\nFor the sample data above, your query should return the following result.\r\n\r\n|accept_rate|\r\n|-----------|\r\n|       0.80|\r\n\r\n\r\nNote:\r\nThe accepted requests are not necessarily from the table friend_request. In this case, you just need to simply count the total accepted requests (no matter whether they are in the original requests), and divide it by the number of requests to get the acceptance rate.\r\nIt is possible that a sender sends multiple requests to the same receiver, and a request could be accepted more than once. In this case, the ‘duplicated’ requests or acceptances are only counted once.\r\nIf there is no requests at all, you should return 0.00 as the accept_rate. \r\n\r\n\r\nExplanation: There are 4 unique accepted requests, and there are 5 requests in total. So the rate is 0.80.\r\n\r\nFollow-up:\r\nCan you write a query to return the accept rate but for every month?\r\nHow about the cumulative accept rate for every day?","templates":[{"value":"mysql","text":"MySQL","defaultCode":"# Write your MySQL query statement below\r\n"}],"testcase":"{\"headers\":{\"friend_request\":[\"sender_id\",\"send_to_id\",\"request_date\"],\"request_accepted\":[\"requester_id\",\"accepter_id\",\"accept_date\"]},\"rows\":{\"friend_request\":[[1,2,\"2016/06/01\"],[1,3,\"2016/06/01\"],[1,4,\"2016/06/01\"],[2,3,\"2016/06/02\"],[3,4,\"2016/06/09\"]],\"request_accepted\":[[1,2,\"2016/06/03\"],[1,3,\"2016/06/08\"],[2,3,\"2016/06/08\"],[3,4,\"2016/06/09\"],[3,4,\"2016/06/10\"]]}}","testable":true,"templateMeta":{"mysql":["Create table If Not Exists friend_request  (        sender_id INT NOT NULL,        send_to_id INT NULL,        request_date DATE NULL)","Create table If Not Exists request_accepted (        requester_id INT NOT NULL,        accepter_id INT NULL,        accept_date DATE NULL)"],"database":true}}
