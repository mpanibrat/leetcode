You need to find the minimum number of steps in order to spell all the characters in the keyword.\r\n\r\nInitially, the first character of the ring is aligned at 12:00 direction. You need to spell all the characters in the string key one by one by rotating the ring clockwise or anticlockwise to make each character of the string key aligned at 12:00 direction and then by pressing the center button.\r\n\r\nAt the stage of rotating the ring to spell the key character key[i]:\r\n\r\n\r\n\tYou can rotate the ring clockwise or anticlockwise one place, which counts as 1 step. The final purpose of the rotation is to align one of the string ring's characters at the 12:00 direction, where this character must equal to the character key[i].\r\n\tIf the character key[i] has been aligned at the 12:00 direction, you need to press the center button to spell, which also counts as 1 step. After the pressing, you could begin to spell the next character in the key (next stage), otherwise, you've finished all the spelling.\r\n\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n\r\n\r\nÂ \r\n\r\n\r\nInput: ring = \"godding\", key = \"gd\"\r\nOutput: 4\r\nExplanation:\r\nFor the first key character 'g', since it is already in place, we just need 1 step to spell this character. \r\nFor the second key character 'd', we need to rotate the ring \"godding\" anticlockwise by two steps to make it become \"ddinggo\".\r\nAlso, we need 1 more step for spelling.\r\nSo the final output is 4.\r\n\r\n\r\nNote:\r\n\r\n\r\n\tLength of both ring and key will be in range 1 to 100.\r\n\tThere are only lowercase letters in both strings and might be some duplcate characters in both strings.\r\n\tIt's guaranteed that string key could always be spelled by rotating the string ring.\r\n\r\n","templates":[{"value":"cpp","text":"C++","defaultCode":"class Solution {\r\npublic:\r\n    int findRotateSteps(string ring, string key) {\r\n        \r\n    }\r\n};"},{"value":"java","text":"Java","defaultCode":"class Solution {\r\n    public int findRotateSteps(String ring, String key) {\r\n        \r\n    }\r\n}"},{"value":"python","text":"Python","defaultCode":"class Solution(object):\r\n    def findRotateSteps(self, ring, key):\r\n        \"\"\"\r\n        :type ring: str\r\n        :type key: str\r\n        :rtype: int\r\n        \"\"\"\r\n        "},{"value":"python3","text":"Python3","defaultCode":"class Solution:\r\n    def findRotateSteps(self, ring, key):\r\n        \"\"\"\r\n        :type ring: str\r\n        :type key: str\r\n        :rtype: int\r\n        \"\"\"\r\n        "},{"value":"c","text":"C","defaultCode":"int findRotateSteps(char* ring, char* key) {\r\n    \r\n}"},{"value":"csharp","text":"C#","defaultCode":"public class Solution {\r\n    public int FindRotateSteps(string ring, string key) {\r\n        \r\n    }\r\n}"},{"value":"javascript","text":"JavaScript","defaultCode":"/**\r\n * @param {string} ring\r\n * @param {string} key\r\n * @return {number}\r\n */\r\nvar findRotateSteps = function(ring, key) {\r\n    \r\n};"},{"value":"ruby","text":"Ruby","defaultCode":"# @param {String} ring\r\n# @param {String} key\r\n# @return {Integer}\r\ndef find_rotate_steps(ring, key)\r\n    \r\nend"},{"value":"swift","text":"Swift","defaultCode":"class Solution {\r\n    func findRotateSteps(_ ring: String, _ key: String) -> Int {\r\n\r\n    }\r\n}"},{"value":"golang","text":"Go","defaultCode":"func findRotateSteps(ring string, key string) int {\r\n    \r\n}"},{"value":"scala","text":"Scala","defaultCode":"object Solution {\r\n    def findRotateSteps(ring: String, key: String): Int = {\r\n        \r\n    }\r\n}"},{"value":"kotlin","text":"Kotlin","defaultCode":"class Solution {\r\n    fun findRotateSteps(ring: String, key: String): Int {\r\n        \r\n    }\r\n}"}],"testcase":"\"godding\"\n\"gd\"","testable":true,"templateMeta":{"name":"findRotateSteps","params":[{"name":"ring","type":"string"},{"name":"key","type":"string"}],"return":{"type":"integer"}}}
